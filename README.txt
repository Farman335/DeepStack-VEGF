****** Steps to reproduce the results ******

1: Datasets folder contains training and testing datasets. 
   
2: The best feature set of each descriptor is uploaded in compressed format.

3: The code of classifiers i.e. Cap-CNN, GRU, FBGAN, and Stacking_Ensemble_Learning are provided in Classifiers folder. 

4: All python codes are implemented in python version 3.6.3 using Keras package with Tensorflow backend.

5: The feature ranking file contains ranking of all feature descriptors feature set.


NOTE: To run the codes of python, the above noted version are required to install in the systems.
